# POS Tagging Project

This project is focused on developing a machine learning model for part-of-speech (POS) tagging. The goal of POS tagging is to assign a part-of-speech tag to each word in an input text.


## Description

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is the process of assigning a grammatical category, such as noun or verb, to each word in a sentence. POS tagging is a critical step in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as machine translation, text-to-speech conversion, and search engines. In this project, we build a machine learning model for POS tagging using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

The HMM is a statistical model that is widely used in NLP for tasks such as POS tagging, speech recognition, and handwriting recognition. The HMM is a generative model that models the joint probability distribution of the observed sequence of words and the unobserved sequence of POS tags. The model learns the transition probabilities between POS tags and the emission probabilities of words given POS tags.

## Dataset
We use the Brown Corpus, which is a collection of over one million words of American English text, with tags assigned to each word. The Brown Corpus is widely used in NLP research and is a standard benchmark for POS tagging models.

We use the first 80% of the corpus as the training set and the remaining 20% as the test set. We preprocess the data by lowercasing all words and replacing rare words with the "UNK" token.

## Implementation
We implement the HMM-based POS tagger in Python 3 using the following libraries:

NumPy: for numerical computing
We first train the HMM on the training set by estimating the transition and emission probabilities from the tagged sentences. We use the forward-backward algorithm to estimate the probabilities.

Then, we use the Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely sequence of tags for a given sentence in the test set. We evaluate the accuracy of the model on the test set by comparing the predicted tags to the actual tags.

We experiment with different feature sets, including word features, context features, and morphology features, and compare the performance of different models.
